# Retinal OCT Model Testing

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to testing pre-trained deep learning models for Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) classification. The goal is to evaluate the model's performance on a given dataset and analyze its predictions through various metrics and visualizations.

We do not train the model in this repository; we solely use and assess it.

## ðŸ§  Retinal Disease Classification with OCT

The dataset used for testing consists of labeled OCT images. Images are organized into folders corresponding to their respective categories, such as:

- `CNV/`
- `DME/`
- `DRUSEN/`
- `NORMAL/`

**Figure:** Representative Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images showing different retinal conditions:  
- **CNV**: Choroidal Neovascularization  
- **DME**: Diabetic Macular Edema  
- **DRUSEN**: Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration  
- **NORMAL**: Healthy retina  

Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross-sections of the retina in living patients. Approximately **30 million OCT scans** are performed each year. The interpretation of these images requires expert analysis and consumes considerable clinical time.

## Installation

To set up the required environment, use the following:

**Using pip:**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Using Conda:**

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate oct-testing
```
